# Introduction

For more information of any commands discussed in this chapter, do a search on any engine search for **`man <command>`**, to view the manual page. For example, to view the manual page for the _**`ls`**_ command, search for _**`man ls`**_.

### Shell prompt convention

The `$` symbol will be used to indicate a shell prompt (defaulting to _Bash_). Some commands may require _root_ privileges via the `sudo` command. However, this documentation will not explicitly specify when `sudo` is required â€”  it should be prepended where necessary.
